# Simple KV

## A Simple KV cache that aims to be fast

---

This is a small personal project to mess around with [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

It’s a fast, in-memory key-value cache using a preallocated arena and per-thread shards. The goal is just to learn, experiment, and see how far I can push Zig for low-level memory and performance stuff.
